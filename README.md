# Learn-Front-End-UI-Design-2020

Learn Programming/Front-End Development (HTML/CSS/Javascript)

Front-End developers are different from back-end devs in that front-end developers manipulate the browsers to create web pages and other interactive content. To learn front-end development, you start off with HTML, then CSS, and then Javascript. Once you've learned those, you can move on to other things like frameworks (Bootstrap, React, Angular, Vue, etc). Frameworks you can start learning once you've learned the basics of the three. Frameworks make lives easier. 

A good programmer does not have to remember everything. Open source code powers the web and allows programmers to use and exchange code for free. If you are stuck on something GOOGLE IT. You'll probably find the answer. 

There are a million tutorials out there. Be careful not to get stuck in what's known as "tutorial hell" where you just endlessly watch tutorials but never learn anything concrete. The best way to learn is BY DOING. Exercise sites like this come in handy, but you also want to think of projects to build. Host those projects on Github for your portfolio. Or look up project tutortials. 

Using Google Chrome Developer tools, you can inspect the code behind any website or make not-live changes. Other browsers like Firefox also have these tools. Make it your best friend. 

Youtube is a really great resource in general. Anything you want to know. It's probably there. A lot of well respected programmers are on there like Wes Bos. Also follow other developers on Twitter. 

The IMPORTANT other thing to know is that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING to get your first job or jobs after that. Programming is ALWAYS CHANGING. A good job will let you learn on the job, hopefully pay you to learn some things, and will teach you what you don't already need to know. 

ASK QUESTIONS - no question is a dumb one. Use Google first. If that fails, reach out to other programmers via forums, Stack Overflow, Facebook Groups or Twitter. Someone will be happy to help you.

HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN I'M READY? 

When you can create a basic website and have a portfolio of a couple different projects. 

1) Website with static and prototypes designs

2) A Github showcasing your code 

If you work on a website that's already live, you don't need a github for it. But they're good for projects that aren't live. 

Regardless of what you do, freelance or volunteer projects will help you gain exp in case you can't get an internship. But developer internships are usually open to people out of school because so many people career swtich. You can also start applying to junior level positions.
